    <h1>Vodka Pizza</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 medium cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2teaspoon of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes, roughly crushed by hand</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of vodka</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>NY style pizza dough ball</li>
        <li>1lbs of fresh mozzarella torn into rough 3/4 to 1 inch chunks and drained in a fine mesh strainer over a
            bowl</li>
        <li>12 to 16 basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper
            flakes and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Increase heat to high,
            bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by 1/4, about 20
            minutes. Add heavy cream, increase heat to bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and continue to cook until
            reduced again by 1/4, about 20 minutes longer. Add vodka and cook for 7 minutes. Remove from heat and season
            to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Let sauce cool slightly, then transfer half of sauce to the jar of a blender. Blend, starting on lowest
            speed and gradually increasing to high until completely smooth, about 2 minutes total. Strain through a
            fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Repeat with remaining half of sauce. (For storing extra sauce, see
            Make-Ahead and Storage below).

        </li>
        <li>At least 45 minutes before baking, place a baking stone or steel on an oven rack set to the top position and
            preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).</li>
        <li>Turn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle,
            leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles into a 12 to
            14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.

        </li>
        <li>Spread approximately 3/4 cup of sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2 to 1-inch border along edge.
            Place 8 to 10 chunks of mozzarella evenly over surface of pizza and scatter with 4 to 5 basil leaves.
            Drizzle with about 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Slide pizza onto stone or
            steel and bake until cheese is melted and crust underbelly is spotty brown, 6 to 12 minutes total. Remove
            from oven with metal pizza peel, transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with
            remaining ingredients to make 2 additional pizzas.</li>
    </ol>
